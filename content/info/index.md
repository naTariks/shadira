shadira is a minimal website for showcasing some of my photographs.\
Photography is a small hobby of mine, especially the analog one, hence the huge amount of grain ;)

If you are interested in my other projects, go check out my portfolio: <u>[nathanrichard.dev](https://nathanrichard.dev)</u>

The website is built with <u>[Hugo](https://gohugo.io/)</u> using <u>[Bridget](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/bridget/)</u>, a theme made by <u>[Spedon](https://github.com/Sped0n)</u>.\
The Hugo Theme is based on the "Bridget Baker" project by <u>[Tyler McRobert](https://tylermcrobert.com)</u>.

font used: <u>[Geist Sans](https://vercel.com/font)</u>
